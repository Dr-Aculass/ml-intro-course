Guidelines

- Not all attributes apply to all models.
- Prediction Made By:
    - Instance
    - Linear bound
    - Nonlinear bound
    - Data distribution
- Small data is ~10-30 examples per class.
- Large data is ~10k-1M examples per class.
- For many of the attributes (e.g., effectiveness, speed, bias, variance, …) each algorithms could be judged the following ways:
	1. Categorized as low or high. 
	1. Judged relative to other algorithms.
